# Thermostat!
> 9-13 July 2018

[Thermostat! is deployed to Heroku](https://archmagos-thermostat.herokuapp.com/).

Thermometer web-app in Javascript that increases/decreases temperature in response to user input, with different conditions according to whether 'power saving mode' is turned on. Connects with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve and display city weather information.

## Technical

Javascript & jQuery with Jasmine for testing.

## Implementation

Download repo and open index.html in browser.

## Further Improvements

* Integrate with Ruby and Sinatra to implement saving state.
* Alert message when temperature reaches upper/lower limit.
